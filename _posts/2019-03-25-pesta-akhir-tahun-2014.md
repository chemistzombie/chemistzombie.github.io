# Pesta Akhir Tahun 2014 Telkomsel Poin

## This was taken from [Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org/web/20150301005431/http://www.telkomsel.com:80/pestaakhirtahun)

So back in 2014 a wireless carrier here did an end-of-year giveaway consisting of a BMW X3, 2 BMW 116i, and 200 Samsung Galaxy Note 4.

I was obsessed by this, not only because I lost the sweepstake, I literally cried in a corner because I've always wanted a flagship phone just to play the most demanding mobile games at the time and flex about how I have the latest flagship phone.

I was actually curious if they were actually giving these things away for real back then, so I checked YouTube to see if anyone has uploaded a video about it (or better, bragging about it) and surprisingly I found one of them. Now normally people don't bother doing this because others might view them as an attention whore, so it's no wonder that videos about people winning these kinds of giveaways are quite rare.

This video is from one of them who won the Galaxy Note 4

And this is the list of winners taken from this [Wayback Machine snapshot](http://web.archive.org/web/20150301005431/http://www.telkomsel.com:80/pestaakhirtahun). Unfortunately I couldn't find the uploader's name on the list (Freddy Juantoro) nor the city they've mentioned in the video description (Banyuwangi) so most likely the uploader's number was registered somewhere else under a different name, but considering the upload date which was on March 2015, I believe this is a legit video and not just someone who pretended to win the phone.
