# A detailed breakdown of PvZW's history and events that I still remember
This is a detailed breakdown of PvZW's history that I compiled for the 10th anniversary event, down to the many minor events, mostly from my perspective. Note that I mainly focus on 2012-2013 here because everything was less mundane back then so it's easier to remember those time periods.

The timeline is sorted in chronological order, with subsequent events being merged into the same day as the first event.

## 2012
### May
* 5 May: I joined the wiki. Coincidentally, I actually joined on PvZ's anniversary date.

### June
* An infamous vandal known as Nazi Peashooter attacked the wiki several times. These series of attacks were done under five different accounts and lasted until February 2013.
	* The first attack occurred on 2 June 2012, under the name of Nazi Peashooter681, which managed to vandalize 22 pages before being blocked.
	* The second attack occurred on 12 June 2012, ten days after the first one, under the name of Nazi Peashooter Is Back. Only 6 pages were vandalized before the account was blocked.
	* The third and most severe attack occurred on 22 June 2012, under the name of Hail Nazi Peashooter, in which 158 pages were vandalized before it was eventually blocked. This happened due to the fact that there were very few active admins at that time, which allowed them to perform attacks that lasted for 15 hours, with a 10 hour break from 1:02 PM to 11:56 PM. It is unknown why they did this, but it might be possible that it was done to avoid detection.
	* The fourth one occurred on 9 November 2012, after over four months of break, under the name of Nazi Peashooter 682. However, it is unknown whether this was a real Nazi Peashooter or simply an impostor because the only article edit done with this account was on the [Hypno-shroom page](https://plantsvszombies.fandom.com/wiki/Hypno-shroom?diff=prev&oldid=124626) and it didn't look like a vandal edit at all, and the rest were edits on their own userpage.
	* The last one occurred on 10 February 2013, three months after the fourth attack. Only four pages were vandalized but they also managed to vandalize my userpage with a very inappropriate content.

### July
* 28 July: Promoted to chatmod, along with Jackass

### September
* 8 September: Wordbubble was added. This template was used for talk page messages, intended to make them look nicer. It is also customizable, allowing for users to modify it to suit their needs. The template still exists today but is no longer used due to the switch to message walls.

### Late 2012
Forums were added. It initially only saw limited use, mainly for wiki discussions, but it quickly became popular (or abused) with the advent of the "Fun and Games" board.

## 2013
### Early 2013
PvZ Adventures released as a closed beta. Everyone WANTED to join the beta testing program but it only had a limited amount of invite links that can only be used for up to 500 users for each link. Princess Kitty was the only more active person on the wiki to successfully join the beta program, and I, along with Jack, literally asked her to leak the contents of it (IIRC). This didn't go well though, as a PopCap employee by the name of PopCapDemian approached us immediately and [warned us](https://plantsvszombies.fandom.com/wiki/Thread:49038) to not leak the contents of the game until its release because they were bound to an NDA. All articles leaking the game's content were shortly removed thereafter. Quoting MignightHawk's post:

>To participate in the Beta, you must agree to a terms and conditions statment, and among the list is the refusal to state any information about PvZA outside of the publically stated info.

### February
* 26 February
[Wiki revamp](https://plantsvszombies.fandom.com/wiki/Thread:42567) made by Gwaine. He didn't really contribute to the mainspace and wanted to be an admin dealing with wiki styles but we accepted it anyway back then because why not. Some of the changes he made include adding the lawn background to elements such as buttons and wiki navigation.

This was one of the most major changes on the history of the wiki.

### April
## 26 April
NDA for PvZA content was lifted, and articles about the game were restored or re-created.

### May
## 20 May
PvZA was fully released for public as an open beta. 

### June
* 3 June
[First excited, then disappointed](https://plantsvszombies.fandom.com/wiki/Thread:54280): Rant over PvZ2 coming to iOS first before Android, just like what many app devs do. If I have to guess it's because iOS has much less device segmentation, which makes it it easier to perform things like bugfixes there.

Despite rumors of it coming out to PC, it never did (Android emulators don't count).

### July
* 9 July: Initial release of PvZ2 on iOS. It was soft launched in Australia first before the international release. I remember some people asking on how to download it when they're not in Australia.

## 2014
Unfortunately I don't remember much about 2014, since that was when I left the wiki for a few months and didn't make a return until the end of the year, but I do know there was a drama involving Napalm Rosalina. Nonetheless I still don't really get what happened.
