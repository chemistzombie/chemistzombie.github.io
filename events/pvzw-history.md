# A detailed breakdown of PvZW's history and events that I still remember
This is a detailed breakdown of PvZW's history that I compiled for the 10th anniversary event, down to the many minor events, mostly from my perspective. Note that I mainly focus on 2012-2013 here because everything was less mundane back then so it's easier to remember those time periods.

The timeline is sorted in chronological order, with subsequent events being merged into the same day as the first event.

## 2012
### May
* 5 May: I joined the wiki. Coincidentally, I actually joined on PvZ's anniversary date.

### June
* An infamous vandal known as Nazi Peashooter attacked the wiki several times. These series of attacks were done under five different accounts and lasted until February 2013.
	* The first attack occurred on 2 June 2012, under the name of Nazi Peashooter681, which managed to vandalize 22 pages before being blocked.
	* The second attack occurred on 12 June 2012, ten days after the first one, under the name of Nazi Peashooter Is Back. Only 6 pages were vandalized before the account was blocked.
	* The third and most severe attack occurred on 22 June 2012, under the name of Hail Nazi Peashooter, in which 158 pages were vandalized before it was eventually blocked. This happened due to the fact that there were very few active admins at that time, which allowed them to perform attacks that lasted for 15 hours, with a 10 hour break from 1:02 PM to 11:56 PM. It is unknown why they did this, but it might be possible that it was done to avoid detection.
	* The fourth one occurred on 9 November 2012, after over four months of break, under the name of Nazi Peashooter 682. However, it is unknown whether this was a real Nazi Peashooter or simply an impostor because the only article edit done with this account was on the [Hypno-shroom page](https://plantsvszombies.fandom.com/wiki/Hypno-shroom?diff=prev&oldid=124626) and it didn't look like a vandal edit at all, and the rest were edits on their own userpage.
	* The last one occurred on 10 February 2013, three months after the fourth attack. Only four pages were vandalized but they also managed to vandalize my userpage with a very inappropriate content.

### July
* 28 July: Promoted to chatmod, along with Jackass

###

### September
* 8 September: Wordbubble was added. This template was used for talk page messages, intended to make them look nicer. It is also customizable, allowing for users to modify it to suit their needs. The template still exists today but is no longer used due to the switch to message walls.

## 2013
### February
* 26 February
[Wiki revamp](https://plantsvszombies.fandom.com/wiki/Thread:42567) made by Gwaine. He didn't really contribute to the mainspace and wanted to be an admin dealing with wiki styles but we accepted it anyway back then because why not. Some of the changes he made include adding the lawn background to elements such as buttons and wiki navigation.

### June
* 3 June
[First excited, then disappointed](https://plantsvszombies.fandom.com/wiki/Thread:54280): Rant over PvZ2 coming to iOS first before Android, just like what many app devs do. If I have to guess it's because iOS has much less device segmentation, which makes it it easier to perform things like bugfixes there.

Despite rumors of it coming out to PC, it never did (Android emulators don't count).

### July
* 9 July: Initial release of PvZ2 on iOS. It was soft launched in Australia first before the international release.
