# Finding the PS2 version's intended cheat codes
The PC version's intended cheat codes have been found a while back when a modder by the name of Alexander Blade discovered a file in the Android version of GTA SA. However, the PS2 version of them still remains a mystery.

Although the PS2 version's cheat code combinations were much more limited, with only around 2250 different combos each, finding the intended one is still quite difficult due to the fact they only consist of button presses, which aren't really that meaningful in most cases, so finding them relies mostly on guesswork.

I've been trying to find some of them using common sense as well as an Excel add-in called [fuzzy lookup](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=15011). This add-in allows me to search for similarities between two different data, which can be useful because some of these cheat codes are only different by a few button presses, such as the spawn Hydra and Vortex cheat codes, and it appears that cheats that are paired in the cheat index number, like the cheap cars and fast cars traffic cheat codes, are very likely to contain similar button combinations with only minor differences in each.

The problem is that this tool is quite buggy because it continuously drains memory while finding the results, causing an "out of memory" error after a while and preventing some progress.

## Some results
**Traffic is fast cars:** R1 Right Right Up R2 Down Square L1 Up Down L2 L2

**Traffic is cheap cars:** R1 Right Right Circle R2 L1 Down Square L1 Down Square L2

**Confidence: medium**

**Fuzzy lookup similarity:** 77%

**Notes:** Although there are cheat codes that have completely random button combos, I'm not 100% sure if this is true. This pattern doesn't seem to make that much of a sense not to mention that there are some other combos as well.



**Always midnight**: X Down Down X Up Up L1 L2 L2 L1

**Orange sky 21:00**: X Down Down X Up Up L1 R2 R2 L1

**Confidence**: high!

**Fuzzy lookup similarity**: Not documented

**Notes**: I'm pretty sure this is the correct cheat code for both cheats considering how the pattern looks very regular.
