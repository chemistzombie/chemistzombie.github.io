# Finding the PS2 version's intended cheat codes
The PC version's intended cheat codes have been found a while back when a modder by the name of Alexander Blade discovered a file in the Android version of GTA SA. However, the PS2 version of them still remains a mystery.

Although the PS2 version's cheat code combinations were much more limited, with only around 2250 different combos each, finding the intended one is still quite difficult due to the fact they only consist of button presses, which aren't really that meaningful in most cases, so finding them relies mostly on guesswork.

I've been trying to find some of them using common sense as well as an Excel add-in called [fuzzy lookup](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=15011). This add-in allows me to search for similarities between two different data, which can be useful because some of these cheat codes are only different by a few button presses, such as the spawn Hydra and Vortex cheat codes, and it appears that cheats that are paired in the cheat index number, like the cheap cars and fast cars traffic cheat codes, are very likely to contain similar button combinations with only minor differences in each.

The problem is that this tool is quite buggy (and shitty, considering Micro$oft made it) because it continuously drains memory while finding the results, causing an "out of memory" error after a while and preventing some progress.

Also, not all these "paired" cheat codes have these similar combinations. For example, the Hotring A and B spawn cheat codes are completely different despite being both official and them being fairly similar vehicles.

I have to tell you about this: I don't think the "prostitutes pay you" cheat code has an intended cheat code, as it has a nulled hash indicating it was actually supposed to be scrapped, so I won't bother finding that one.

## Frequent traits of intended cheat codes
Judging from the already-discovered intended cheats that came straight from Rockstar as well as a bit of common sense, there are a few traits that intended cheat codes have. The rule of thumb is as follows:
- Intended cheat codes usually have very regular button patterns not commonly found on the random "unintended" ones, such as the one from the spawn jetpack cheat code.
- A pair of cheat codes that are adjacent to each other in the cheat index number and have some similarities in their effects usually have fairly similar combinations, save for a few differences (e.g. jetpack and parachute cheat codes)
Note that some of the intended cheat codes they published don't really make much sense, so chances are we're only going to be able to find a few of them, unless if Rockstar for some reason published all the intended ones or some leaks revealed the whole thing.

**Traffic is cheap cars:** ![R1](/images/l1.gif) ![Right](/images/r.gif) ![Right](/images/r.gif) ![Circle](/images/c.gif) ![R2](/images/r2.gif) ![L1](/images/l1.gif) ![Down](/images/d.gif) ![Square](/images/s.gif) ![L1](/images/l1.gif) ![Down](/images/d.gif) ![Square](/images/s.gif) ![L2](/images/l2.gif)

**Fuzzy lookup similarity:** 77%

**Confidence**: Not really sure.

**Notes:** Although there are cheat codes that have completely random button combos, I'm not 100% sure if this is true. This pattern doesn't seem to make that much of a sense not to mention that there are some other combos as well.

**Fuzzy lookup similarity**: Not documented

**Confidence**: high!

**Notes**: I'm pretty sure this is the correct cheat code for both cheats considering how the pattern looks very regular.

## Commonly known cheat codes that are probably intended
I'm gonna exclude some commonly known cheat codes that aren't published by Rockstar from the search list because they seem legit and regular enough that they're most likely the intended ones. They are:

1. Never wanted
2. Six star wanted level
3. Sandstorm
