# Finding the PS2 version's intended cheat codes
The PC version's intended cheat codes have been found a while back when a modder by the name of Alexander Blade discovered a file in the Android version of GTA SA. However, the PS2 version of them still remains a mystery.

Although the PS2 version's cheat code combinations were much more limited, with only around 2250 different combos each, finding the intended one is still quite difficult due to the fact they only consist of button presses, which aren't really that meaningful in most cases, so finding them relies mostly on guesswork.

I've been trying to find some of them using common sense as well as an Excel add-in called [fuzzy lookup](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=15011). This add-in allows me to search for similarities between two different data, which can be useful because some of these cheat codes are only different by a few button presses, such as the spawn Hydra and Vortex cheat codes, and it appears that cheats that are paired in the cheat index number, like the cheap cars and fast cars traffic cheat codes, are very likely to contain similar button combinations with only minor differences in each.

The problem is that this tool is quite buggy (and shitty, considering Micro$oft made it) because it continuously drains memory while finding the results, causing an "out of memory" error after a while and preventing some progress.

I have to tell you about this: I don't think the "prostitutes pay you" cheat code has an intended cheat code, as it has a nulled hash indicating it was actually supposed to be scrapped, so I won't bother finding that one.

<!-- Presumably, Rockstar originally wanted to publish these unreleased cheat codes slowly, releasing them to gaming sites and magazines such as IGN or Tips & Tricks, possibly to increase its replay value by luring people into testing out these fun cheats. However, fans obviously couldn't afford to wait and wanted to get them as soon as possible, and thus, brute-forcing methods were used in order to find these unreleased cheats. As a result, Rockstar eventually didn't bother releasing them. -->

## Frequent traits of intended cheat codes
Judging from the already-discovered intended cheats that came straight from Rockstar as well as a bit of common sense, there are a few traits that intended cheat codes have:
- Intended cheat codes usually have very regular button patterns not commonly found on the random "unintended" ones, such as the one from the spawn jetpack cheat code.
- A pair of cheat codes that are adjacent to each other in the cheat index number and have some similarities in their effects usually have fairly similar combinations, save for a few differences (e.g. jetpack and parachute cheat codes)

Note that these are just the general rule of thumb. Some of the cheat codes they released do have combinations that don't seem to make much sense, such as some of the spawn cheat codes (e.g. Rhino, Bloodring, or Rancher), so most likely we can only find those that make sense, as those that don't make sense are likely to be misinterpreted as "unintended" chat codes.

Also, not all of these "paired" cheat codes have these similar combinations. For example, the Hotring A and B spawn cheat codes are completely different despite being both official and them being fairly similar vehicles.

## Some results
### A. Most likely to be intended
**Always midnight**: :x: :d: :d: :x: :u: :u: :L1: :L2: :L2: :L1:

**Orange sky 21:00**: :x: :d: :d: :x: :u: :u: :L1: :R2: :R2: :L1:

I'm sure this is the correct cheat code for both cheats considering how the combinations look regular and similar.

---

**Infinite health**: :t: :x: :x: :c: :c: :s: :L1: :R2: :L2: :R1:

This is most likely the intended cheat code, judging by the combo.

---

**Cars float away when hit**: :L2: :R1: :R2: :L1: :X: :x: :c: :c: :s: :s:

Same reason as above

---

**Riot mode**: :d: :r: :s: :s: :t: :t: :x: :x: :L1: :L2:

Same reason as above

---

**Thunderstorm**: :R2: :T: :R2: :T: :C: :C: :L: :R: :U: :U:

I didn't notice this one until now when I started to peruse these patterns more carefully. It appears that this is most likely the intended one, and the fact that it's 10 button presses long just like the sandstorm cheat code further implies it.

---

**All cars have nitro**: :D: :T: :D: :4: :X: :4: :C: :U: :C:

Forms an ABA-CDC-EFE pattern.

---

**Recruit anyone (9mm)**: :3: :3: :D: :R: :X: :X: :S: :C: :X: :X:

---

**Recruit anyone (rockets)**: :U: :S: :C: :L: :1: :L: :1: :C: :S: :T:

## B. Not really sure if intended
These are some of the cheat codes that do form some kinda pattern but I'm unsure if they're the intended ones. Be aware that I might just be misinterpreting random noises here, because it's hard to tell the difference between an intended cheat code and the random ones sometimes.

<!-- **Traffic is fast cars:** ![R1](/images/l1.gif) ![Right](/images/r.gif) ![Right](/images/r.gif) ![Up](/images/u.gif) ![R2](/images/r2.gif) ![Down](/images/d.gif) ![Square](/images/s.gif) ![L1](/images/l1.gif) ![Up](/images/u.gif) ![Down](/images/d.gif) ![L2](/images/l2.gif) ![L2](/images/l2.gif)

**Traffic is cheap cars:** ![R1](/images/l1.gif) ![Right](/images/r.gif) ![Right](/images/r.gif) ![Circle](/images/c.gif) ![R2](/images/r2.gif) ![L1](/images/l1.gif) ![Down](/images/d.gif) ![Square](/images/s.gif) ![L1](/images/l1.gif) ![Down](/images/d.gif) ![Square](/images/s.gif) ![L2](/images/l2.gif)

**Fuzzy lookup similarity:** 77%

**Notes:** Although there are cheat codes that have completely random button combos, I'm not 100% sure if this one is true. This pattern doesn't seem to make that much of a sense not to mention that there are some other combos as well.

---
-->
**Adrenaline mode**: :T: :R: :D: :1: :2: :S: :S: :3: :4: (TRD-12-SS-34)

Not sure about this one, but that :1: :2: :3: :4: pattern might not be a coincidence.

---

**Infinite ammo**: :D: :X: :D: :X: :3: :4: :U: :T: :L: :C: (DXDX-34-UTLC)

This might be a coincidence but it might be the intended one since both :d: and :x: buttons are both located at the bottom while :u: and :t: are at the top, creating a pattern, but :l: and :c: aren't (they contradict each other), but considering how Rockstar deliberately does this kind of thing in their own cheat combinations sometimes, it might be possible they did this intentionally to prevent people from discovering it too quickly while fiddling around with the controller (e.g. the weapon set 1 cheat where it's :3: :4: :1: :4: instead of the more regular :3: :4: :1: :2:).

---

**Spawn Hunter**: :U: :L: :U: :R: :U: :C: :S: :D: :4: :1: (ULURU-CS-D-41)

Again, not really sure about this one, but "up-left-up-right-up" seems to form a pattern, so this might be it.

---

**Hitman in all weapon stats**: :X: :D: :X: :D: :C: :1: :D: :C: :1: :1: (XDXDC-1DC11)

**Max all vehicle skill stats**: :X: :D: :X: :X: :C: :L: :L: :1: :3: :1: (XDXXC-LL131)

While they might not look very similar, these are the only 10-button combinations for them that have a bit of similarity to it, particularly at that :X: :D: :X: _ :C: part

---

**Country traffic + born 2 truck outfit**: :3: :2: :1: :L: :R: :1: :2: :3: :T: :4: :D: (321-LR-123-T4D)

---

**Funhouse theme**: :D: :U: :D: :U: :U: :1: :2: :R: :R: :3: :4: (DU-DUU-12-RR-34)

---

**Traffic is cheap cars**: :X: :T: :X: :T: :S: :U: :U: :D: :1: :2: :3:

---

**Reduced traffic**: :D: :T: :D: :R: :L: :R: :U: :D: :U: :R:

Forms an ABA-CDC-EFE pattern with a random button at the end I guess?

---

**Do nothing**: :U: :D: :2: :3: :4: :L: :U: :D: :L: :L: :L: (UD-234-LUD-LLL)

I'm not really sure about this one. There are actually two cheat codes for this one that look as if they're intended enough, but I chose this one since the pattern looks more like what you'd expect in these intended stuff.

I know this one's a useless cheat code, but still, considering the hash isn't nulled it's probably supposed to be functional at one point

## Commonly known cheat codes that are probably intended
I'm gonna exclude some commonly known cheat codes that aren't published by Rockstar from the search list because they seem legit and regular enough that they're most likely the intended ones. They are:

1. Never wanted
2. Six star wanted level
3. Sandstorm
