              Welcome to the longest post I've ever made. <mark aria-details="intro">With Natlan around the corner and a lot of people's hopes and theories for the region surrounding a Signora return (or lack thereof)</mark>, I wanted to create a reference of all discussion topics I found covering the character, their story and the possibility of a banner.

If anything, consider this a handbook or reference to look at to see if there are any arguments you've missed out on or any different takes.

This post contains much more "Pro-Signora" news than "Anti-Signora" news because most of the arguments against a Signora return are based on things we already know or a simple lack of information on her. Usually, there's just more to talk about, interpret or dissect concerning news about potential playability. Since we already know she's probably dead (assuming a reliable narrator) and that her last on-screen appearance was Sumeru, I'm not concerned about going in-depth about that. However, I do consider points against a return/banner if they add more beyond the obvious things we know atm. If you feel I misrepresented arguments for Signora staying dead/reviving, let me know and I'll be sure to revise them.
<br/>
<br/>
[Full disclosure, I am biased towards a Signora return and would love to play her. I'm F2P and am willing to become a moderate spender to get her (based on her kit and my finances at the time). I like the character and would love to see her banner one day. Based on my current knowledge of the game, she's one of the characters whose release will probably make me the happiest to see. Despite that, I am still trying to be as objective as possible with anything I talk about and give equal credence to every argument. I just wanted to make my bias known ahead of time, in case I say something off-base so you (the reader) can let me know. If I feel that a point I make is overly subjective or prone to my bias, I will try to label it as such.]

              This is a foreshadowing, but unfortunately it seems like there has been a lack of information regarding Signora's resurrection and return as of 5.1, which has serious implications for her playability in Natlan.

              This is more of a housekeeping part, but for some reason beyond me, there is a lot of toxicity in the Genshin Community, especially concerning discussion around the Harbingers and especially La Signora.
			  There was an organized raid of Signora main subreddits, there's a weird blood feud between Venti mains and Signora mains and lots of memes that range from kind of funny to overused and mean-spirited
			  with the intent to demean various demographics within the Genshin community.

              Now, as somebody who has been talking with a variety of Genshin fans for a while and following discussions, I have to just clarify that WE ARE ALL ON THE SAME SIDE.
			  This is a SINGLE PLAYER GAME, there is no reason to try to get into somebody else's head over this game or to start harassing people for what fictional character they like.
			  Raiding subs, insulting people for who they enjoy in the game or trying to troll people who want to have actual conversations about the game has always been stupid and is always staying stupid.
			  Engaging that is brainless, I don't care what the reasoning might be or who people want to shift the blame on. Most discussions around La Signora are tense and filled with bitterness when they really shouldn't be.

            Sometimes, people really are just that toxic and would do anything to make others feel miserable.
			Also, Signora is portrayed as the "bad guy" early on, so her first impression might have stuck to these people and they just shut down any attempts of reasoning,
			because they simply don't have the reading comprehension to understand her background and how she came to be, instead preferring to judge characters solely from the surface-level details.

              This is basically to say, that I won't be considering any argument of "I don't want Signora back because I don't like Signora mains and want them to be happy" or
			  "I want Signora back so I can dunk on Venti/Raiden mains and want to see them get upset" or "but X and Y mains are on copium and responsible for everything bad in Genshin".
			  If this is your position or the main reason for feeling what you do, you seriously need to reconsider what you're doing, because you are objectively the bad guy in this situation.
			  From my experience, these arguments are not indicative of any group's fanbase and <mark data-annotation-id="1" aria-details="hated">most of the people who hold these opinions seem to be hated in their community too.</mark>

                It depends on the subreddit. Certain communities just have a stronger bias against Signora, either because they wanted to feel oh-so-powerful by picking a character to shit on, in which Signora is the ideal candidate for a strawman because to this date, she remains to be the only playable-looking character to have died and with a very unceremonious death, or they simply don't like the premise that a "bad guy" they hate so much might be able to be brought back on a whim by the writers.

                This is correct, as overgeneralization of groups is stupid and uncritical. However, do keep in mind that this vocal minority tend to band together and attack Signora fans in the main subreddits, which makes the general population look worse than they really are.

              Any "us vs them" mentality over a video game is stupid, and they're quite rightfully poked fun. Usually, this loud minority is easy to identify and ignore since their main arguments include the attempt to unironically use words like "simp" or "cope" or jam overused memes or broad stereotypes into every conversation. However, they scare off more temperate people or new players who want to discuss the game and characters they love by making it seem like there are more toxic assholes than there are. Loud minority and all that. Genshin has a lot of players and a lot of fans of various characters and the reasons can vary from design to lore to personality or a mix of them. Venti Mains, Signora Mains, Raiden Mains, etc... there are more friendly faces among their players than you think, so give them a chance and try not to ostracize people for enjoying the game in their way. We all benefit from a happier, more passionate player base. There are new players that don't give a shit about our drama and they just want to share their passion for the game.

It's stupid I have to make this preface over a post discussing a fictional character, but I guess the battle was lost when a bunch of goons started organizing raids of subreddits and harassing people for no reason.

                Honestly, every single argument that anti-Signora proponents have can be countered just by marketing reasons alone. Companies will always seek to earn more profits, and executives sometimes make decisions that would otherwise defy all logic and reasoning if they feel that it will make them more money.

                Hoyo was once a moderately-sized company prior to them releasing the smash hit that is Genshin Impact. This might have changed their business strategies since then, as I will explain below.

                Because Hoyo is a far bigger company right now than it was back then, I believe that they're far more incentivized to seek for more revenue than they were before, as with every mature company out there. Therefore, their business strategies might have shifted to earn revenues more aggressively, as evidenced by them releasing several new titles such as HSR and ZZZ despite Genshin still being one of the most popular mobile games out there and HI3 still being actively updated. This means that if the Harbingers are deemed very profitable, as backed by 3rd-party statistics such as paimon.moe, analysts and investors alike are far more likely to encourage the developers to make more Harbingers playable, and that could also include bringing Signora back.

            <p>
              This is a fair argument, <mark aria-details="pullreason">a lot of people may want to collect all the harbingers or just really like Signora</mark>. She's the first villain character a lot of people imprinted on and therefore holds nostalgia and a special place in the hearts of a lot of people interested in the story. She has one of the most devoted fanbases and the human brain always wants whatever is harder to get, so a lot of people are still on the Signora train with many having their love for the character grow in her absence. There is a problem with this argument, which I'll touch upon alongside its counterargument.

            Alternatively, people like me just wanted Signora due to her detailed background lore of being the Crimson Witch of Flames. I'd like them to elaborate on that by giving us a deep dive into her daily life and personalities via story quests, or even interacting with her in the form of events. It would be a huge waste of lore if they end up never resurrecting her, as they would never follow up on her CWOF background if this is the case. Not to mention that playable characters have birthdays, which means that every year, Hoyo makes or commissions artists to make two artworks (regular and chibi-styled) on their birthdays which are wholesome, even for the "bad guys" like Arlecchino or Childe. Leaving her unplayable means that they will never make birthday artworks for her.

			Argument 2 (Anti-Signora): "<mark aria-details="popular">Signora isn't that popular (even among Harbingers)</mark> and Hoyo can just release any other hyped character to make equal/better money on banner sales (Arlecchino, Archons, etc...)"

			</h4>
            <p>
            Once again, a fair argument. My issue with these two arguments is that, without a massive, wide-spanning survey, we don't know what the standard is. We don't know average banner sales for characters, and we don't know if the current interest in Signora falls short of or surpasses average banner earnings. If Signora has enough fans to surpass average earnings, then it doesn't matter that she is less profitable than a handful of other Harbingers/Archons. Hoyo has the incentive to release any character that they will believe can perform above average. I'd say average banner earnings are the most worthwhile metric to use as a baseline for whether a character is profitable or not and not outliers like Raiden, Arlecchino, Hu Tao and the most popular characters of the game. It's all about making more profit than expected.</p>

			<p>It doesn't matter what the community feels about Signora. If the execs (or the powers that be) want her to be playable just because they think that Harbingers have always sold very well regardless of popularity, then the writers will find their own ways to accommodate for her.</p>
			<p>
            The numbers show that the Harbingers have usually had a very successful launch, often being the 2nd or 3rd most successful characters of the region according to data sourced from paimon.moe (Arle being the 2nd most successful character in 4.x for instance).
			</p>
			<p>
			IMO, if I were an analyst over on Hoyo, we would treat that as a sign that our customers want more Harbingers, and therefore push for more of them to be playable. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Some negative but extreme examples of how execs can make changes regardless of what the community feels. I'm well aware that these are negative examples, but the point is to show you how execs are usually the ones that make the final call when it comes to larger companies:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Discord redesigning their logo despite the community preferring the old one.</li>
            <li>Discord changing the username format from Username#0000 with the ability to use capitalizations and special chars to just lowercase username with no discriminators, preventing people from using the same name if it's been taken. There was a community uproar about this, but it fell on deaf ears.</li>
            <li>Reddit's API changes that prevent 3rd party apps from being able to use the service unless if they pay an exorbitant fee for API access.</li>
            <li>Microsoft's forced TPM requirement to install Windows 11 without bypass methods.</li></ul>

            [My Take: It does seem that Hoyo can come up with new characters and, with enough effort in Archon Quests or events, get enough hype to beat their average earnings (take the recent Arlecchino banner). Signora was set up in the story in a very potent way and would have probably made rather sizable earnings for Hoyo, especially compared to other characters who barely show up in Archon Quests. I think there is a high likelihood a La Signora banner would exceed average banner earnings, giving Hoyo a reason to make her playable. However, other Harbingers may be believed to be more profitable in the immediate future (Capitano/Colombina), assuming Hoyo doesn't cook with whatever story may surround a La Signora return. Unfortunately, with the prolonged wait for her return, the impact of her character probably has worn off for some players, so the "free money" won't be as free as it once could have been. Hoyo would likely want to focus more on her story before a banner to make her release more potent for casual players.]
