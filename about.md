A 23 year old nobody.

I used to actively maintain [my YouTube account](http://youtube.com/TheChemistZombie) but nowadays I don't do it anymore due to all the controversies surrounding YouTube's services such as the "adpocalypse", video demonetizations, and bogus video takedowns. I even got my channel removed from partnership because I didn't meet the new requirements that were enforced after Logan Paul's controversy in 2018. After all of those I just completely lost my interest in doing YouTube videos. It's turned into some kind of a hellhole at this point.

### Phones I've owned
1. **Xperia L (2013 - 2016)**. First ever Android phone I've owned. Upgraded to 4.4.4 and then 6.0 with a custom ROM as it only received a single version update throughout its life from 4.1.2 to 4.2.2. Its modem became faulty in 2015 or so, frequently throwing "[Sorry, the phone crashed!](https://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i199/t5chav/DSC_0009.jpg)" errors, with the log indicating that the modem crashed. The phone eventually became unusable in 2016, after the screen went purple sometime during a lunch break back in high school.
2. **Galaxy J1 (2016 - 2017)**. Handed down from my parents. Sold in exchange for a Oneplus One.
3. **Oneplus One (2017 - 2018)**. Was once dubbed the "flagship killer" due to Oneplus selling it at a low price with flagship-grade hardware. Upgraded to Android 8 when the stock ROM is stuck on Android 6. Suffers from phantom touch issues like many other OPOs. Accidentally dropped it during college orientation, which shattered the screen and rendered the touchscreen unusable, due to it using a [touch-on-lens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Glass_Solution) screen assembly.
4. **Redmi Note 4 (2018 - 2021)**. Another hand-me-down device. The phone became very slow over time likely due to the internal storage wearing out.
5. **Galaxy Note FE (2021 - 2023)**. Bought this phone due to it having Android 9 despite technically being part of the same generation as the S7, which only received updates up to Android 8 (it is in fact just a Note 7 with a less explosive battery) as it was released in 2017 like the S8 and Note8. Because of this, it has One UI 1.0 which was also used on the S10 lineup at launch.
6. **Galaxy S10+ (2023 - present)**. I initially wanted the S10e due to its compact size, but realized that battery life might be an issue due to it approaching 4 years old. The last good Samsung flagship because it still has a 3.5mm jack and micro SD slot.
7. **Galaxy Note 4 (2024 - present)**. Despite being 10 years old at this point, I bought this phone to fulfill my broken childood dream of owning a Galaxy Note 4 from a state-owned mobile carrier sweepstakes campaign. This sounds stupid, but it means a lot to me that it probably deserves its own post. I'm using this alongside the S10+ as a secondary device as the Indonesian model is 3G only, and 3G has been phased out in here since 2022, effectively making it 2G-only.
