title: About me

I'm just a college student who's currently studying public health. I picked the nickname "Chemist Zombie" after the same character in PvZ Garden Warfare. IDK why but I just like that character so much, presumable because he looks both nice and goofy at the same time (tattered outfit, wears only one shoe, upside-down goggles, etc).

While I'm not really that interested in PvZ anymore (the franchise is mostly dead at this point), I'm an administrator on the [Plants vs. Zombies Wiki](http://plantsvszombies.fandom.com/wiki/User:Drek'TharSuperSword), and I've been there since 2012, mostly because that way I could meet some new friends and shit now that they've got Discord up and running (I hate other forms of online interactions like Facebook due to how shitty they are now).

I used to actively maintain [my YouTube account](http://youtube.com/TheChemistZombie) but nowadays I don't do it anymore due to all the controversies surrounding YouTube's services such as the "adpocalypse", video demonetizations, and bogus video takedowns. I even got my channel removed from partnership because I didn't meet the new requirements that were enforced after Logan Paul's controversy in 2018. After all of those I just completely lost my interest in doing YouTube videos. It's turned into some kind of a hellhole at this point.
